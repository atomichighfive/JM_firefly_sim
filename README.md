Simulation of pulse coupled synchronizing oscilators och a graph of heterogeneous phase and frequency based on Joel Nishimuras article "Frequency adjustment and synchrony in networks of delayed pulse-coupled oscillators". (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.91.012916)

This simulation is part of a Batchelor's project at Chalmers University of Technology where we analyze synchronizing pulse coupled systems and construct a demonstration of one such system.
